The **AutoFlex API** is the robust RESTful back-end service powering the [AutoFlex Web](https://github.com/brunomaatias/autoflex-web) application. It handles the core business logic, data persistence, and automated calculations for industrial production planning and inventory management.

## ✨ Core Responsibilities

* **Raw Materials Management:** Endpoints to create, read, update, and delete raw materials, keeping track of stock levels.
* **Product Catalog & BOM:** Manage final products and their Bill of Materials (the specific raw materials and quantities required for manufacturing).
* **Production Calculations:** A dedicated engine that calculates the maximum possible production yield for each product based on current raw material availability.
* **RESTful Architecture:** Clear, predictable, and resource-oriented API endpoints.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** Java
* **Framework:** Spring Boot (Spring Web, Spring Data JPA)
* **Architecture:** REST API
* **Containerization:** Docker (Ready for containerized deployment)
